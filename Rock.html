                        <h3>‘Purple Haze’ by Jimi Hendrix</h3>
                        <p>There are famous riffs, and then there’s ‘Purple Haze’. As usual, Hendrix was operating on a level wholly 
                        different than that of mere mortals, laying down an effortlessly original blend of freaky psych and screaming 
                        old-school blues with enough panache to seem like he really could just excuse himself for a few minutes to kiss the sky (or this guy) 
                        if he wanted to.</p>

                        <h3>‘Whole Lotta Love’ by Led Zeppelin</h3>
                        <p>Zeppelin achieved god-tier fame and redefined music throughout the ’70s, all but defining the term ‘epic’ in 
                            rock thanks to its explosive compositions, blues-rock detours, Tolkien-inspired head trips and the thunderous approach to
                            blowing minds. ‘Whole Lotta Love’, from the quartet’s second album, solidified Zeppelin as rock’s next great thing, serving almost as
                            a mission statement for what the band would unleash upon the next decade. From Jimmy Page’s chugging guitar to John Bonham’s mortar-blast
                            drums and Robert Plant's delirious yelp, the band struts throughout. It’s a frenzied, lightheaded trip that only slows down for a second in the middle.
                            Maybe it does so to allow listeners a chance to breathe.</p>

                        <h3>‘Sympathy for the Devil’ by The Rolling Stones</h3>
                        <p>We’ve forced ourselves to pick just one Stones song, and it gave us about 19 nervous breakdowns. But few songs 
                            capture the essence of the Stones at full power quite like ‘Sympathy for the Devil’. Those unexpected hand drums 
                            from the late, great Charlie Watts. Keith’s sloppily perfect guitar solo. Mick starting off with feral yowls and 
                            only escalating the sexual deviousness as the song climbs to crescendo. ‘Satisfaction’ is more iconic and ‘Start Me Up’ 
                            more ear-wormy, but ‘Sympathy’ is the Stones doing everything they do at once, and doing it all just right.

                        <h3>‘Comfortably Numb’ by Pink Floyd</h3>
                        <p>This epic track from the band’s magnum opus, 1979’s ‘The Wall’, is a distillation of everything Floyd — swirling, 
                            psychedelic organs, a doom-laden narrative of druggy madness and multiple heaven-scraping solos from David Gilmour, 
                            all searching for some sort of redemption through the haze. It’s a moment of calm amid the constant storm of Floyd’s landmark double album. </p>

                <h3>‘Under Pressure’ by Queen & David Bowie</h3>
                <p>This 1981 song’s bassline is so brilliant it was borrowed by Vanilla Ice nearly a decade later for ‘Ice Ice Baby’, 
                    a 1990 pop-rap hit that topped the charts globally. But the bassline is just one part of the original song’s alchemy. 
                    Over the top you have two of rock’s greatest icons, Freddie Mercury and David Bowie, singing poignantly and powerfully 
                    about the sheer pressure of life in the modern world. ‘Under Pressure’ emerged from an impromptu jam session involving Bowie, 
                    Mercury and his Queen bandmates Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon, giving it an infectious looseness that’s impossible to 
                    imitate. Even now, it sounds like nothing else. </p>
